## How cookies are used on NHS.UK

### Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)

We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use
NHS.UK. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users
and to help us make improvements, eg improving site search.

Google Analytics stores information about:

  - the pages you visit on NHS.UK
  - how long you spend on each NHS.UK page 
  - how you got to the site 
  - what you click on while you’re visiting the site

We don’t collect or store your personal information (eg your name or address)
so this information can’t be used to identify who you are.

We don’t allow Google to use or share our analytics data.

Google Analytics sets the following cookies:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Expires</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>_ga</td>
      <td>This helps us count how many people visit NHS.UK by tracking if you’ve visited before</td>
      <td>2 years</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>_gat</td>
      <td>Used to manage the rate at which page view requests are made</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>_utma</td>
      <td>Like _ga, this lets us know if you’ve visited before, so we can count how many of our visitors are new to NHS.UK or to a certain page</td>
      <td>2 years</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>_utmb</td>
      <td>This works with _utmc to calculate the average length of time you spend on NHS.UK</td>
      <td>30 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>_utmc</td>
      <td>This works with _utmb to calculate when you close your browser</td>
      <td>when you close your browser</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>_utmz</td>
      <td>This tells us how you reached NHS.UK (eg from another website or a search engine)</td>
