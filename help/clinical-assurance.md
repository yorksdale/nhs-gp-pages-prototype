# How we make sure NHS.UK Alpha content is medically sound

We have a GP in the NHS.UK Alpha team who reads and approves all content before
it’s published.

Where knowledge of specialist experience has been required, we’ve consulted:

  - practising doctors and other healthcare professionals, with experience in
    dealing with the condition
  - patients who have been directly affected by the condition

All content has been written using evidence based sources including:

  - NHS Choices
  - NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries
  - National charities with a recognised expertise and specialist interest
