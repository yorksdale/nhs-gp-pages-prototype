#Getting diagnosed
Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed following blood or urine tests for something else.

However, if you have any [symptoms](/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it) you should see your GP straight away.

##Before your diagnosis
To find out if you have type 2 diabetes, you usually have to go through the following steps:

1. Speak to your GP about your symptoms.
2. Your GP will check your urine and arrange a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. It usually takes about 1 to 2 days for the results to come back.
3. If you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in again to explain the test results and what will happen next.

##If you’re diagnosed with diabetes

What your GP will discuss with you during your initial appointment depends on the diagnosis and the treatment they recommend.

Generally, they’ll talk to you about:

- what diabetes is
- what high blood sugar means for your health

Your GP will do their best to discuss the diagnosis with you but this first appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes long.
