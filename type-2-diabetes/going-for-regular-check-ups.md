Type 2 diabetes check ups help to make sure your condition doesn’t lead to other health problems, for example with your eyesight, heart or your feet.

## Every 3 months

### Blood sugar checks (HbA1C test)

Checks your average blood sugar levels and how close they are to normal.

## Once a year

Checks if you’ve lost any sensation in your feet and possibly for ulcers and infections.

You have these checks once a year. 

Speak to your GP if you have cuts, bruises, or numbness in your feet.

You have these checks once a year.

## What happens after your appointment

The person you have the appointment with, for example your diabetes nurse, will tell you how long it takes to get the test results and if you need to come in again.
