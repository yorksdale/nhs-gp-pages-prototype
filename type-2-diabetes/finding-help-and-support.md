#Finding help and support for type 2 diabetes

There is a lot of information and support available for type 2 diabetes. Some of the support depends on the area you live in.

##Understanding type 2 diabetes

Type 2 diabetes type means you have too much glucose in your blood. It happens when your body doesn’t produce enough of the hormone insulin, or when your cells don’t react to insulin.  

You have type 2 diabetes for life.  Controlling your blood sugar levels with medicines, diet and exercise, should allow you to lead a healthy life.
