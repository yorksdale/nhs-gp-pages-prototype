Usually nail infections affect your toenails but you can get them on your finger nails too.

They can be painful and cause the skin around the nail to swell.

    You can usually treat fungal nail infections yourself at home without seeing the GP.

The affected nail will grow out. It can take up to 12 months for a healthy nail to grow back.

Fungal nail infections are caused by a fungus. You are more likely to get them if you have [athlete’s foot.](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Athletes-foot/Pages/Introduction.aspx)

##Treat smaller infections without medicine

You should:

- keep your feet clean and dry
- use separate clippers or scissors to cut your infected nails

If you can see a healthy nail grow back at the base the infection has stopped. Cut the old nail off as it grows out.

You can also buy antifungal nail paint online or at the pharmacy. It can take 6 to 12 months to cure the infection, depending on the size of the nail and it doesn’t always work.

##Use medicated cream for bigger or painful infections

You should use a cream that removes the nail if it’s:

- painful
- bothering you
- spreading to other nails

You can buy the cream online (search for ‘fungal nail removal cream’) or at the pharmacy. It takes about 2 weeks to get rid of the infected nail and it’s painless.


##See your GP for severe nail infections

Your GP can prescribe you tablets. The most common ones are terbinafine and itraconazole.

The tablets can have side effects including:

- headaches
- itching
- loss of sense of taste
- diarrhoea

Antifungal tablets can damage your liver. Your GP will do a blood test before prescribing these as you shouldn’t take them if you have certain conditions or you’re pregnant.

Sometimes badly infected nails have to be removed by surgery. It’s a small operation done under local anaesthetic.

For severe infections you can also get laser treatment to destroy the fungus. However, you’ll have to pay for it yourself as it’s not covered by the NHS.

##Keep your feet clean and dry to prevent nail infections
Nail infections develop when your feet are constantly warm and damp. You’re more likely to get an infection if you wear trainers for a long time and have hot, sweaty feet.

Things that will help prevent nail infections:
