#Managing depression and anxiety
 
There is lots of support out there to help you manage your depression or anxiety.

##Talking to people who know what it’s like
Being open and talking to people who’re dealing with depression and anxiety can help with:
 
- focussing on more positive things that have happened
- making things look less black and white
- not thinking the worst
- not thinking of yourself badly
 
Your GP might be able to refer to:
 
- local befriending groups - meet a trained volunteer and do something enjoyable together
- peer support worker - someone with depression and anxiety who can help you access services

##Being active for 20 minutes a day helps
20 minutes of exercise a day can help with your depression or anxiety.
 
Exercise releases a chemical in your brain called endorphins which lifts your mood.
 
Ask your GP for a prescription for exercise. This will refer you to a local gym for free.
 
If the gym isn’t for you, there are many ways you can be active.  

###You can exercise anywhere
 
Exercise can be anything that gets you slightly out of breath, for example:
 
- walking - try walking part or all the way to work
- housework
- gardening - [find a gardening project in your area](http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/ecotherapy/finding-a-programme/#.VmAbeNDquU4) or work outside with [Green Gym](http://www.tcv.org.uk/greengym)

##Keeping in touch with people
Socialising helps you keep active and grounded.

Keeping in touch with people can feel difficult when you feel depressed or anxious but facing your fears is an important part of managing your condition every day. 

Try to talk to friends and family regularly and meet up with them whenever possible. 

[Volunteering](https://www.gov.uk/government/get-involved/take-part/volunteer) can also be a good way to meet people while helping others. 

##Noticing the things around you
The way we think affects the way we feel. When we’re busy and stressed we often develop a ‘tunnel vision’ and rush through life. 

Every day try to take a moment to stand back and notice: 

- what you’re thinking
- how you’re feeling 
- what’s happening around you

Try not to think of anything else. 

This is called ‘mindfulness’. It can help you notice signs of stress, anxiety or depression earlier and deal with them better.
  
Things like yoga, breathing exercises and meditation can also help you being more aware. 
 
##What you eat can affect how you feel
When your body is healthy, it helps you feel better about yourself.
 
Try not to skip meals drink lots of fluids (preferably water). Dehydration can affect your mood.
 
Every day try to eat:
 
- fruit and vegetables 
- starchy foods, like pasta, rice or bread 
- protein foods, like lean meat, fish, beans, cheese, nuts or yogurt

##Alcohol can make depression worse
Try not to drink too much alcohol. 

- Men should not drink more than 3 to 4 units a day 
- Women should not drink more than 2 to 3 units a day

3 units is about one pint of beer or a large glass of wine.
