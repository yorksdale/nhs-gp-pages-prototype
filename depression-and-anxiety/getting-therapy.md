#Getting therapy

Talking to a therapist can help with:

- understanding why you feel the way you feel
- dealing with negative thoughts and feelings
- finding ways of coping every day

Usually treatment for depression and anxiety can include: talking to a therapist, medication, and self-help such as exercise.

There are many different types of talking treatments.  The charity Mind has more information about [types of therapy.](http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/talking-treatments/types-of-therapy/#.VmBFKHbhCM8)

##How to get therapy on the NHS

1. Speak to your GP about the way you feel.
2. If your GP thinks therapy is the best treatment, they’ll either refer you for therapy in your area or give you the number for a service that provides therapy in your area.
3. You phone the local service, or they'll call you (if your GP referred you), they’ll ask you some questions and refer you to a therapist.

Alternatively, you can call your local service without speaking to your GP. [Check you have IAPT services (Improving Access to Pyschological Treatment) in your area.](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Psychological-therapies-(IAPT)/LocationSearch/10008)

##Waiting times can be long
Waiting times can range from a few weeks to up to one year.

Ask your GP about waiting times when they refer you. If they’re too long you might want to consider paying for therapy yourself (see below).

##Therapy is around 6 to 12 sessions
The NHS usually covers 6 to 12 sessions. A session is around one hour.

After that you’ll have to review your situation with your GP. They might prescribe further sessions or recommend something else. Sometimes simple changes, like exercising regularly, might help.

##Changing therapists
It’s important you feel comfortable with your therapist and can be open with them. If this isn’t the case, the sessions won’t help you.

There are no rules about how to find this out. You have to trust your instinct.

If you’re not happy with your NHS therapist you should do the following:

1. Think about why you feel therapy isn’t working.
2. Speak to your GP about the problem.
3. If you both agree you should continue with therapy, your GP should be able to refer you to a new therapist.

##Paying for therapy yourself
You can also go directly to a therapist without using the NHS. You don’t need a referral from your GP and you can usually start right away.

The price per therapy session varies between £10 and £100, depending on where you live. Bigger cities, like London tend to be more expensive. Some therapists adjust their prices according to your income.

The charity [Mind](http://www.mind.org.uk/) offers counselling free of charge.

##If you don’t want to talk to your GP
If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your GP about the way you feel, you can contact one of the charities that help people with depression and anxiety.

They can help you with things like talking to other people about your problem or finding a therapist, but they won’t be able to prescribe you free therapy or counselling.
